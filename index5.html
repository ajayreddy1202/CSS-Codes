    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of a computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making.
     It is a broad field that encompasses various disciplines, including computer science, data analytics, and statistics, among others.
     AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans may miss.
     These systems use algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions that guide the AI's analysis and decision-making.
     AI can be categorized into different types, such as reactive machines, limited memory AI, theory of mind AI, and self-aware AI, although most modern AI is considered limited memory.
     Additionally, AI is used in various applications, including virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
